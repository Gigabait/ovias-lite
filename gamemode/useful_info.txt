Ovias is a pretty cool gamemode.
===========================================
Besides entities, all the code for the gamemode is done in the classes folder.
This allows for an easily scalable gamemode structure, where imports aren't technically important. 
All files in the class folder are loaded automatically, obviously respecting their scope.
- sv_ files are loaded on the server
- cl_ files are loaded on the client
- sh_ files are loaded on both scopes.
The order files are loaded in is: Shared, Server, Client. This means sh_ files are loaded before the specific scope file is.

Classes are objects created that contain methods and variables to seperate gamemode features.

You have to intialize a class with an empty table, and register it when you've completed. 
For example:


==========
SF.Foobar = {}

SF.Foobar:Initialize()
    print("The gamemode initialized!")
end

SF:RegisterClass("svFoobar", SF.Foobar)
==========

Notice how an initialize function has been added, this is because all gmod hooks are also passed down and called on the class objects.
A class can be called anything, so long that it does not conflict with other class names.

A helpful hint:
Because sh_ files are loaded prior to sv_ and cl_, you can get away with starting a shared class, then registering each class seperately in the desired scope.
This can be seen used in the territory class.
